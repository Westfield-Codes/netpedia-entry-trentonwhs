<h1>THE START</h1>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/">NVIDIA</a> Company was founded on April 5th, 1993 by Jensen Huang, Curtis Priem, and Chris Malachowsky. With a dream to bring 3D graphics into gaming, and multimedia markets. NVIDIA started off with 3D graphics then just 2 years later in 1995 they started manufacturing graphics cards/GPU. NVIDIA was the first company to ever release a GPU, with the first release being in late 1999 with the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/">Geforce 256.</a>  The reason of the GPU being named "Geforce" instead of "NVIDIA" is because in 1999 Nvidia held a contest called "Name That Chip"</p>
